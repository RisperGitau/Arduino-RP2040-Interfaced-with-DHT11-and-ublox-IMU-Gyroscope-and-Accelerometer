# Arduino-RP2040-Interfaced-with-DHT11-and-ublox-IMU-Gyroscope-and-Accelerometer

This is a DIY Project where you need the arduino RP2040 Microcontroller and the DHT 11 Temp and humidity sensor.

The arduino RP2040 has an inbuilt/ embedded 6 axis gyroscope and accelerometer IMU sensor capable of measuring several factors like speed, acceleration, direction, angular rate, etc. 

Connect DHT 11 to the RP2040 . The 3 lines connected are the data ,vcc and ground pins.
Run the code in the arduino IDE.

When the sensor is well interfacd and connected on the IDE the output data on the serial monitor is that of the gyroscope angles , accelerometer on the X ,Y ,Z Axis and dht temp and humidity data.
